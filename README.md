# Reversi + Shorter Tag Blurbs + Tag Color Groups

This is the AO3 skin I am currently using.



It's based on the [Reversi](https://archiveofourown.org/skins/929) skin, the [Shortening long tag fields skin](https://archiveofourown.org/skins/3756), and [a site skin for borders around and backgrounds for the tags](https://archiveofourown.org/works/34928095).



I also edited the skin beyond just combining the above:

* The tags on a work (i.e. the page you read the fanfic on) are also colored and bordered similarly to the blurbs.
* The fandom tags in the tag blurb are still highlighted, but they aren't bordered and don't take as much space. 
* The visited link color is adjusted slightly so it contrasts more with the background.
* Only non-"No Archive Warnings Apply" warnings are highlighted. (I tried to do something similar with Explicit/Mature/Not Rated tags on work pages, but couldn't quite manage it ^^:)
